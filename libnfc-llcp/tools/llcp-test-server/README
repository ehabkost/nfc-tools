llcp-test-server
================

This is an attempt to port nfcpy's examples/llcp-test-server.py against the
libnfc and linfc-llcp.

The following tests are known to fail:
  2, 8	- Require libnfc-llcp to be compiled in a special way to provide the
          same limitation as nfcpy.
  5, 6  - Tests are buggy.
