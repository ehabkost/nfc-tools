Hello hackers!

General remarks about contributing
----------------------------------

Contributions to the libnfc-llcp are welcome!  Here are some directions to get
you started:

  1. Install Cutter
     Cutter is a cool unit test framework for C code.  You will need it to run
     the regression tests suite (`make check') and ensure that your code does
     not break other features.

  2. Install log4c
     Log4c is a logging library for C programs inspired by log4j library.  It
     provides higly customizable and flexible logging.  While not a replacement
     for a debugger, it can help to diagnose quickly what's going wrong.

  3. Follow style conventions
     The source code of the library trend to follow some conventions so that it
     is consistent in style and thus easier to read.  Basically, it follows
     FreeBSD's style(9); adding 4-space indentation and 8-space tabs (which you
     should configure in your editor, e.g. `:set sw=4 ts=8 sts=4' in vim).  You
     are also advised to `:set cinoptions=t0(0:0` so that you don't have to
     care about indentation anymore. For more details, please read the style(9)
     man page from FreeBSD's website:
     http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=style

  4. Write tests
     I told you cutter is lovely in #1 so you really should use it!  If you
     want to contribute code, write test: only code with appropriate tests will
     be considered.  And remember that TDD (Test Driven Development) is cool
     and writing all tests at the end deeply depressing, so test early, test
     often!


Various guidelines
------------------

  - To ease up maintainability, please respect the following policy for
    functions return values: functions returning pointers SHALL return NULL in
    case of failures, and all other functions SHOULD return a negative number
    in case of failure.  Consequently, C99 booleans SHALL not be used as return
    values of any function since `true' and `false' or both greater or equal to
    0.
